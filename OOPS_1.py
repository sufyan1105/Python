#  Class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).    

# class Student:
#     name = "Sufyan"
#     age = 21

# s1 = Student()
# print(s1.name)

class Car:
    color = "Blue"
    
c1 = Car()
print(c1.color)  # Output: Blue
